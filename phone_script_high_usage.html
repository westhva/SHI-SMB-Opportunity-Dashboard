                    <p>Canva has a process where I can request high level usage insights for my customers and I've proactively asked for your summary. I have the results back and wanted to share with you that <strong>[X] number of unique users are using Canva at [Organization name]</strong>.</p>

                    <p><strong>I'm doing this exercise with a lot of my customers and they're often surprised that there's so much usage of Canva in their organisation, were you expecting it to be this high?</strong></p>

                <span class="script-label">FOLLOW THROUGH</span>
                <div class="script-text followthrough">
                    <p>Most of the customers I'm sharing this information with are getting surprised by the number of people using Canva within their organisation. The main reason I'm proactively getting this information for my customers is that the people using Canva at work are likely using an individual licence, which presents quite a few risks to an organisation of your size. The big 3 things that I like to make my customers aware of are as follows:</p>
                    <p><strong>Firstly,</strong> if a user is licensed with the individual version, the <strong>design content is owned by the user, not the company</strong>. There's also <strong>no ability to retain design IP</strong> if an employee departs.</p>
                    <p><strong>Secondly,</strong> individual licences can <strong>only be paid for by credit card</strong> and the <strong>licence is always tied to that user</strong>, with <strong>no ability to transfer that licence</strong>. If a user leaves the organisation, <strong>they take their software with them</strong>.</p>
                    <p><strong>And lastly,</strong> it <strong>doesn't offer Single Sign On</strong> or give you the ability to control important security items such as <strong>AI usage and model training</strong>.</p>

                <span class="script-label">SET UP TO GET THE MEETING</span>
                <div class="script-text setup">
                    <p>Based on my understanding of how you like to manage software in your organisation, I felt like it was worth making you aware. To address these challenges with my customers, I wanted to let you know that Canva have a version that gives you full control over everything we've spoken about called <strong>Canva Enterprise</strong>.</p>
                    <p><strong>Discovery Question:</strong> If you're open to it, I'd like to set up a follow meeting with you to review your current usage in more detail and explore how Canva Enterprise might better align to your IT governance/compliance standards. How does that sound?</p>
                    <p><strong>Follow through:</strong> Great, I'd also bring along a specialist from Canva to help with any questions you might have. At a later stage, they can also provide the actual user email IDs and version types to give you a full picture as well.</p>
                    <p><strong>Could any of these dates/times work for you?</strong></p>

                <h3>💡 Key Tips for This Script:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Be conversational</strong> - Don't read it word-for-word, use it as a guide</li>
                    <li><strong>Lead with data</strong> - The usage number is your hook ("X users at your company")</li>
                    <li><strong>Focus on risk</strong> - IP ownership, credit card sprawl, lack of SSO are real IT concerns</li>
                    <li><strong>Position as helpful</strong> - You're making them aware of something they should know</li>
                    <li><strong>Bring Canva specialist</strong> - Always mention you'll bring a Canva expert to the meeting</li>
