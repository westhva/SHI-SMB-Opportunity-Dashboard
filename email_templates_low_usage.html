                        <p>Hi <span class="placeholder">[IT/Procurement Contact]</span>,</p>
                        <p>Hope you're doing well. I wanted to run something by you that's a bit outside our usual Microsoft conversations.</p>
                        <p>We've been working with Canva to help organizations consolidate their design and content creation tools. I'm seeing this roll out a lot for marketing, sales, and internal teams who need to create presentations, social media graphics, documents, etc. without going through a design team bottleneck.</p>
                        <p><strong>A few examples I've seen:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Healthcare client saved $40K by moving recruitment team off Adobe (they were only using it for basic graphics)</li>
                            <li>Manufacturing client empowered their sales team to create custom pitch decks using brand-locked templates</li>
                            <li>Financial services company consolidated 15 different scattered design subscriptions into one platform with proper admin controls</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Here's where you come in:</strong> I'd like to facilitate a quick intro between Canva and whoever handles marketing materials or brand assets on your side. The call would be for them, not you - but if it ends up being something they want to implement, you'd be the one setting it up with SSO and user provisioning, so better to be in the loop early.</p>
                        <p>Would you be open to making that introduction? Or if you'd rather get context yourself first, happy to set up a brief call for just you and me with Canva - totally low-key.</p>
                        <p>Let me know what makes sense.</p>
                        <p>Thanks,<br>

                        <p>Hi <span class="placeholder">[IT/Procurement Contact]</span>,</p>
                        <p>Quick question - do you have visibility into what design or content creation tools your teams are using across the organization?</p>
                        <p>I ask because we're working with several clients who discovered they had shadow IT in this area - scattered Canva accounts on credit cards, individual Adobe subscriptions, free tools that pose data concerns. It usually flies under procurement's radar until someone actually looks.</p>
                        <p>We've been working with Canva to help consolidate this category. From an IT/procurement perspective, the benefits are pretty straightforward:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>SSO/SCIM integration</strong> - not managing another credential set</li>
                            <li><strong>Centralized billing</strong> - instead of dozens of credit card subscriptions</li>
                            <li><strong>Usage visibility</strong> - admin controls to actually see who's using what</li>
                            <li><strong>Adobe optimization</strong> - most people with Creative Cloud only need basic design capability</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Example:</strong> One client discovered 73 individual Canva Pro subscriptions they didn't know existed. Consolidated to Enterprise, got better controls, actually reduced cost. Another client cut their Adobe footprint by 40% by moving non-designers to Canva.</p>
                        <p>Not saying this is definitely relevant for <span class="placeholder">[Organization Name]</span>, but would you be open to a 30-minute call with Canva? They can walk through the admin/procurement side and we can see if there's an efficiency play here.</p>
                        <p>Low commitment - worst case you spend 30 minutes. Best case you get ahead of shadow IT and optimize some software spend.</p>
                        <p>Let me know if you're open to it.</p>
                        <p>Best,<br>

                <h3>💡 Tips for Using These Templates:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Template 4:</strong> Use when you know they have a marketing/brand team. Positions as cross-functional intro.</li>
                    <li><strong>Template 5:</strong> Use for IT/Procurement contacts. Focuses on operational efficiency and shadow IT.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lead with examples:</strong> Real client stories make it credible (40% Adobe reduction, 73 subscriptions)</li>
                    <li><strong>Low-pressure language:</strong> "30-minute call," "low commitment," "totally low-key"</li>
                    <li><strong>Frame as discovery:</strong> Not pushing a product, exploring if there's a fit</li>
                    <li><strong>Make it easy:</strong> Offer multiple paths (make intro, get context first, send one-pager)</li>
                    <li><strong>Use their language:</strong> Shadow IT, admin controls, procurement efficiency</li>
